Three observable trends apparent in the data:

In terms of age, we see a normal distribution with the maximum number of customers in the 20 to 24 age bracket, 365, and highest overall spend at $1,117. The numbers get lower at you get to both the younger ages (under 10) and older ages (40 and over). We see a similar pattern in number of players, with the 20-24 having the most players at 258, and fewer players as we move both older and younger from there.

The average spend per item stays relatively consistent across all age groups, around $3. The biggest difference in spend by age group is due to the number of users and purchases, not the cost of the items.

In terms of gender, males make up the majority of both players (84.03%) and purchases (653).
